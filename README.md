I created this to incorporate it into a discord bot to roll dice for my group's Dungeon and Dragon's campaign. 
You can message me if you want to see how I added it to a discord bot. 


Sample input would be "1d3 + 1d3+3d3+5d5 -32 -3d3 + 3d2"
In my case for the discord bot, it's "$roll 1d3 + 1d3+3d3+5d5 -32 -3d3 + 3d2"
